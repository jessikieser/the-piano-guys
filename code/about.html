           <h5>MEET PAUL ANDERSON, PRODUCER AND VIDEOGRAPHER OF THE PIANO GUYS.</h5><br><p > Born in Blythe, CA, Paul and his family moved to St. George, UT when he was around 12 years old. Growing up he had traditional piano lessons, but quit as a teenager because he thought it “wasn’t cool”. While serving on a mission, Paul had his first experience with a digital piano and all of the sounds it could create. This started his love for the keyboard.
             <br><br>
        Fast forward to when he began working for Crystal Springs Water delivering product. His route included a Piano Dealership, and after delivering water there one day, he started playing on a Yamaha Clavinova Digital Piano, proceeding to show a customer all of the cool stuff the piano could do, and ended up selling it. The manager was so impressed he offered Paul a job on the spot. Coincidentally, a secret crush of Paul’s worked at a store in the same mall, and like history often goes, they dated and eventually married in 1995. They now have four attractive, intelligent, talented children, as Paul says, all thanks to his wife.</p>

            <div class="stevenp">
           <h5>MEET STEVEN SHARP NELSON, CELLIST AND SONGWRITER OF THE PIANO GUYS.</h5><Br><p > An award-winning, Billboard-charting, YouTube rock star (in a cellist sort of way), Steve’s passion for music can be seen in everything he does. Steven joined the Piano Guys in 2011 and enjoys confusing everyone that wonders why a cellist is called a “piano guy.”
               <br> <br>
Steven goes by the mantra Johann Sebastian Bach used: music is for the Glory of God and for the enlivening of the soul. He also believes that, as Beethoven once said, “Music is the electrical soil in which the spirit lives, thinks, and invents.” He doesn’t take himself too seriously and insists that no musician should. He draws his inspiration from a firm belief in a loving God, two incredible parents that sacrificed so much to offer him the opportunities he enjoys today, and most of all an amazing wife and four cute-as-can-be children.</p>

            <div class="jonp">
           <h5>MEET JON SCHMIDT, PIANIST AND SONGWRITER OF THE PIANO GUYS. </h5><br><p > Jon was born to German immigrant parents, and they gave him the gift of early education in music. Classical training fell on the fertile ground of Jon’s natural talents for music and hard work. Schmidt began composing as early as age 11, started teaching piano lessons when most people get a drivers license, and began a successful solo career in his early twenties.
               <br> <br>
Jon worried about a career in music. He worried that his family would think that sheet music does not taste good with ranch dressing, so in college he studied English with plans to get an MBA. People kept pestering him over and over to play piano for them, so he risked renting a large concert hall and presented himself to the public. His audience loved him. He has never turned back to English and Business plans. And his wife Michelle and their five children have never had to eat sheet music—even as a side dish.</p>

            <div class="alp">
           <h5>MEET AL VAN DER BEEK, MUSIC PRODUCER AND SONGWRITER OF THE PIANO GUYS</h5><br><p> Al was born in Tokoroa, New Zealand to a Dutch father and a Samoan mother — thus making him one of the first DutchSamoans in existence. His family moved to Salt Lake City, UT when he was about four years old. His parents instilled a strong passion for music in all of their children, and they frequently sang in four part harmony together. As a result of all of the music–love, Al taught himself to play multiple instruments by ear—guitar, drums & piano are a few of his favorites.
                <br><br>
In high school, Al formed a Hip-Hop group called 4-On-The-Floor with three
of his best friends. After winning a local talent show they soon found themselves opening up for many well known groups. He then opened his own home recording studio in 2004. He went full-time with The Piano Guys in May of 2011 and plays the roles of music producer, songwriter, sound engineer, vocalist, prankster and fashion police.</p>

           <h5>HOW DID THE PIANO GUYS GET STARTED?</h5><br><br> <br> <p> What do you get when you mix up a marketing genius that does video, a studio engineer
that writes music, a pianist that had a successful solo career, and a cellist that does pretty much everything? The Piano Guys: a miraculous meeting of “guys” with the same intrinsic purpose—to make a positive impact in the lives of people all over the world through music videos.
It all started in a piano store in a little southern Utah town called Saint George. Paul Anderson, the store’s owner, was looking for
a new, unconventional way to market pianos. The name of the piano store? The Piano Guys. Paul embarked upon a self-guided study
of social marketing and started a YouTube channel and a Facebook page. He had seen videos “go viral” and was fascinated by
this exponential phenomenon. He set out
to engage potential customers with music videos that were entertaining and that showcased the pianos he had in his store— envisioning “viral videos” doing his marketing for him. Paul was an ambitious, talented risk taker and felt inspired that if he could find the right people to work with he could create the number one music video channel in the world.
                <br><br>
In walked Jon Schmidt. Literally. Jon had built a career in solo piano performance and had
a concert in the St. George area. He asked Paul if he could practice on one of the store’s pianos in preparation for his gig that night. Paul explained his idea to Jon and asked if he would be willing to be in a video promoting both the store and Jon’s music. It was a win-win. Jon brought so much to the table. He had experienced the “music business” first hand. He had a gift for combining multiple genres of music in such an entertaining way that he had captivated and captured a broad, substantial fan base.</p>

                <p class="startedp">
Enter Steven Sharp Nelson. When Steve was 15 years old he met Jon when they had shared the stage at a concert in which they were both performing. Steve started joining Jon at more and more of his concerts. This rapidly grew into a great friendship and a complementary stage chemistry that had audiences in stitches and in tears in two songs or less. Steve was a multi- instrumentalist that had pioneered a new approach to the cello and to songwriting. And his ADHD-fueled creative mind contained a queue of song and video ideas waiting to be produced.
Then came Al van der Beek. Al showed up on Steve’s doorstep to help when Steve was moving
in just down the street. Al had heard Steve was a musician and he invited his new neighbor to his home where he housed a decked-out studio. Steve and Al began writing tunes together and discovered a supernatural songwriting partnership. Al’s studio and his engineering skills were to become the most important music-writing tool for The Piano Guys, except of course for Al himself, whose innate ability for songwriting had an essential sleek edge to it.
                <br><br>
Meanwhile, back at the piano store, employee Tel Stewart, who started as a piano mover, was just completing a degree in videography. His videography and editing skills rounded out
TPG’s beginnings and made it possible to include special effects like the “Steve clones” and lightsaber cello bows! Jeremy Crawford, who also worked at the store, was arguably the best and most fearless piano mover in the world (at least as far as we know!) Without Jeremy, our Piano Stunt Coordinator, no one would have ever asked the question that we get so often, “How the heck did they get the piano up there?” Jeremy also stepped up to fill an important operations role as TPG grew so fast we couldn’t keep up. Shaye Scott, a friend of Paul’s, also jumped onboard during the genesis of TPG helping out wherever he could, then left for a year, and came back to lend his videography talent and quirky humor for the group. Currently, Paul and Shaye are producing and filming the videos as Tel has left the company to start his own endeavors.
                <br><br>
Our story is a miracle. We’re just a bunch of ordinary “guys” playing classically influenced instrumental music in videos that showcase incredible locations. And we’re doing well
on YouTube?? There are so many coincidences that the summation of each circumstance transcends “happenstance.” We do not take credit for our successes. We cannot. To do
so would defy reason. We thank God, our families, and the people who have supported us
by sharing our videos, purchasing our music, and encouraging us through comments and messages. Our mission will always be to produce music videos that inspire, uplift, and make the world a better place. If we can make a positive impact in even one person’s life it has all been worth it to us.</p>
